								<h2 class="major">COVER LETTER</h2>
								<p>Dear Hiring Team,</p>
								<dr>Hope you day is going well. I am writing this letter to apply for recently advertised position for engineering and visualization of public health data. I am very interested in this opportunity and believe that my qualifications, education, and professional experience would make me strong candidate for the position.</dr>
								<dr>I am completing my degree in Data Science which included modules on Python, R and Jmp. This allowed me to learn about the application of different programming languages and the arithmetic patterns behind it. This gave me an understanding of the use of different programming languages. On the other hand, I am good at expressing myself in words. I can speak and write three different languages in addition to programming languages. I write in Chinese and have won awards in national (China) essay competitions. During the summer, I gained some influence by posting content I was just interested in on social media in Chinese and Cantonese. Attached is my resume that fully detail my background and work experience. Please contact me at any time at yangfanc@iastate.edu.
								</dr>
								<p>Finally, I am good team player, self-motivated and eager to learn. I firmly believe that I am an asset to your team. I welcome the opportunity discuss my experience and how that can help you achieve your goals.</p>
								<p>Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.<p>
								<p>Sincerely,<p>
								<dr>Yangfan Cai</dr>
